Securing_Wifi_Networks_By_Cracking_Them-Experiment
==================================================
This repo contains the results of experiments carried out w.r.t. Wifi Networks using a set of tools available as part of the BackTrack security tools distribution, as part of my Cyber Security Course in Fall '12. These were carried out in order to analyze various wifi network configuration scenarios for their security import and then to identify best practices to improve improve overall security of the examined wireless network.
